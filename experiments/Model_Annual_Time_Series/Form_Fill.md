### 6.Current job title
Post-Doctorate Research Associate (PDRA)

### 7.Current project/programme name
Program: Data-Centric Engineering. Project: Theoretical Foundations of Digital Twins for Complex Engineering Systems

### 8.Current Programme Director
Mark Girolami

### 9.Please give a brief description of your main research interests

I am a cross-disciplinary researcher with a track record of publications, as well as invited and contributed conference/seminar talks in machine learning, statistical physics, physics of fluids, and applied mathematics [I have 26 refereed research publications, including 2 book chapters, and 33 contributed/invited conference talks]. My research interests lie at the interface of applied probability, computational statistics and machine learning, with a particular focus on complex systems, including many-particle systems, complex fluids, engineering systems and, more recently, climate physics. 

During my 3-year postdoctoral work at Turing in the group of Andrew B. Duncan, I worked on Digital Twins (DT) for complex physical and engineering systems. I developed a number of novel data-driven techniques and algorithms, including data-driven discovery of physical laws using Bayesian learning, probabilistic digital twins based on variational auto-encoders, and automated discovery of low-dimensional data manifolds. These and other aspects of DT technology are applicable across a wide range of disciplines, far beyond the Data-Centric Engineering (DCE) program. 

I am very interested in exploring applications of DT technology in the sector of Environment and Sustainability (ES). To this end, I recently started collaborating with ES, represented by Scott Hosking, and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), represented in this case by Steve Colwell (Head of Meteorology and Ozone monitoring) and Jonathan Shanklin (presently retired; co-author of the original "Ozone Hole" paper [Farman, J. C., Gardner, B. G. and Shanklin, J. D. Nature 315, 207-210 (1985)]. Together we work on applying the DT technology I developed at Turing to build a data-driven theory of ozone layer over Antarctica, which is a stepping stone towards a DT the Ozone Hole and a DT of Antarctica. Our first results are extremely promising (more details in following sections). 

### 10.Please state in a clear plan how you would use the Turing Research Fellowship to add value to one or more of the Turing's strategic aims. This can include the external placement aspect.

To address this point, I first outline my principle plan of work for the duration of the Fellowship, including proposed research goals. I then concretely describe the added value to Turing's strategic aims and the principles of the emerging Turing 2.0

PLANNED RESEARCH AND PLACEMENTS:

The fellowship provides a minimum of 12 month at Turing to work on one of the Institute's strategic priorities. I plan to work in close contact with Scott Hosking from Turing's ES theme, exploring the application of DT technology to a number of challenges in ES, including the following research objectives (1) data-driven discovery of zenith equations governing the ozone amounts and design of a DT of the Ozone Hole over Antarctica; (2) optimal placement of environmental measurement stations using Bayesian experimental design techniques; (3) understanding the global sea level changes by making a predictive data-driven model of the Antarctic ice sheet. These and other avenues of research will ultimately lay a pathway towards the creation of a Digital Twin of Antarctica, enabling humanity to get answers to “what-if” questions of global significance. 

The fellowship also provides opportunities to pursue secondments within other organisations for up to 24 months. This aspect is ideally suited to enable meaningful collaboration with a number of Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) institutions, such as BAS, National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS). Research objective (1) listed above already generated significant interest at BAS and I have secured BAS principle agreement to offer me a secondment as part of the Fellowship. Research objectives (2) and (3) are highly relevant to NOC and NCAS interests and securing further placements in those should be straightforward. Thus, I plan to spend the 24-month part of the Fellowship within one or more of the NERC institutes, as well as at Turing. 

Additionally, the Fellowship will also allow me to contribute to the DCE challenges, particularly "data-driven design under uncertainty". This is also related to my research at Turing, as outlined in the section on research interests. Here, I plan to collaborate with one of the DCE strategic leaders, Omar Matar, who also leads a Fluids group at Imperial College London (ICL). I have interest and principle agreement of Omar Matar to do joint work on DTs for complex engineering systems, based on Navier-Stokes equation, diffusion and stochastic forcing. The deliverables here will include high-profile joint publications and conference presentations, and joint applications for research funding. This may also lead to a short-term placement at ICL.

VALUE ADDED TO TURING'S STRATEGIC AIMS AND TURING 2.0 PRINCIPLES:

As mentioned above, I recently started collaborating with Turing's own ES project and BAS on data-driven discovery of zenith ozone equations [research objective (1) above]. This work lifts existing limitation to monitoring ozone in real-time: presently known governing equations and technology rely on direct visibility of the Sun. By combining my DT technology, developed at Turing, with BAS' expertise in ozone physics and in-situ experimental instruments (e.g., Dobson spectrophotometer), we work towards a full DT of Antarctic Ozone Hole. The Fellowship structure and format are uniquely and ideally suited to enable the success of this collaborative effort between Turing and BAS, as well as other NERC institutions. This synergistic collaborative work and the deployment of the AI models we build in-situ in Antarctica adds value to the Turing's aim of "using the Turing's trusted brand to lever resources across local, national and international organisations.". Additionally, Environment and Sustainability which the Fellowship will address and contribute to is one of the Grand Challenges of the Turing 2.0

More importantly, my Fellowship will enable Turing and UK to pioneer and lead the first data-centric uncertainty-quantifying approach to the ozone layer modelling and enable UK to create a DT of the Ozone Hole, and (on a broader scale) a DT of Antarctica. Thus the Fellowship will add value to Turing's strategic aim of "supporting the UK's needs and ambition to be a global leader in data science and AI."

Furthermore, the fact that the Fellowship will build upon the DT technology, which I developed within the DCE programme, and enable a close link between the DCE programme and the ES project, directly contributes to the Turing's aim to "provide additionality and multiplicative forcing to the existing landscape."

The Fellowship will enable me to strengthen collaborations across UK institutions (Turing, BAS, ICL, NOC and NCAS), publicise results through high-impact research articles (e.g., Nature, Science, PNAS) and conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML), and apply for research funding from funding bodies inside UK (e.g., EPSRC) and globally (e.g., ERC). This will maximise the impact of synergistic cross-disciplinary efforts within Turing [DT, DCE and ES], as well as strengthening the Turing's brand nationally and internationally. Such cross-institutional synergy directly adds value to the Turing's strategic aim of "brokering and convening research capability at scale...building on the strengths of partners across the UK". Furthermore, climate change and sustainability are among the principal national challenges of UK. This and the collaborative nature of my research within the Fellowship directly add value to the Turing's aim of "undertaking collaborative research with partners in academia, industry...and government to address national challenges."

Finally, the Fellowship offers me an unmatched opportunity for career acceleration. My targeted "exit" from the Fellowship is to create my own research group within Turing or one of its partner institutions. The novelty of proposed research has potential to nucleate an entirely new field of ES-oriented DTs, which lies at the cross-roads of Machine Learning and AI, Data-Centric Engineering, Environmental Science and Physics. This adds value to Turing's goal to "provide leadership across the national skills agenda in data science and AI."

### 11.Briefly explain why you would like to be considered for the Turing Research Fellowship programme.

I spent a significant portion of my professional life in academia. As a postdoc at Turing and before that, I have gained extensive experience in research, teaching and even administrative and representation duties. My ultimate goal is to get a permanent academic position. The Fellowship will enable me to achieve this goal by allowing me to continue deep inter-disciplinary collaborations with Turning's themes, and form synergistic collaborations with national and international research institutions, as outlined in the section above. 

The DT techniques I developed and validated during my postdoc experience (discussed above) will be built upon and applied to significant ES challenges, thus multiplying their impact. Thus the Fellowship offers an ideal vehicle to capitalise and build on my existing work at Turing, thus forming a bridge between deep theoretical foundations of DTs that I worked on and hands-on applications in several areas of Environmental Science. 

I believe that Turing and UK are at the moment uniquely positioned to be the first to develop and deploy a DT of Antarctica. This will include a DT of the Ozone Hole and a DT of Antarctic ice sheet. Along with tremendous fundamental value, these technologies will also be able inform strategic decisions and governmental policies globally around the world. This challenge and opportunity will be the pinnacle of my professional life, with Turing Fellowship being a unique and ideal platform capable of bringing the ambitious research goals outlined above to fruition.

### 12.Please outline how you match the essential skills from the Turing Research Fellow job description (available on Mathison).

To address this point, I first systematically demonstrate that I meet all skills and requirements as outlined in the Turing Research Fellow job description. I then discuss aspects of my work experience, relevant to the engagement with the Turing Research Fellowship Programme Manager to develop the present Turing Fellowship. This includes my teaching experience and ability to contribute to the Turing Skills activities. 

(1) `PhD or equivalent experience in an area relevant to AI and Data Science`; `Research Associate experience in an area relevant to AI and Data Science`; `Degree in a relevant subject or demonstrated interest and experience in data science and artificial intelligence or relevant scientific discipline`

I hold a PhD from Imperial College London. My PhD work focused on developing computational algorithms for complex statistical-mechanical systems and physics of fluids. I also developed a computational toolbox for classical density functional theory.

Over the past three years I was a PDRA at Turing in the DCE program, working on the project "Theoretical Foundations of Digital Twins for Complex Engineering" (my contract ends on May 1, 2023). My current PI is Andrew B. Duncan.

My work at Turing included (1) developing probabilistic DTs, based on variational auto-encoders, for a number of complex statistical-mechanical, stochastically driven systems; (2) developing novel efficient inference methods utilising probabilistic DTs; (3) developing Bayesian experimental design and sensor placement methods, utilising probabilistic DTs (4) developing a novel sampling method for Markov Chain Monte-Carlo, which significantly improves sampling speed by learning the diffusion tensor (equivalently, the mass matrix in hybrid Monte-Carlo) in a data-driven fashion. 

(2). `You will be able to develop collaborative research and capability development strategy for your research`
`You understand the tenets of and consistently deliver research impact.`
`You are able to define the requirements for research and lead the delivery of these collaborative research activities e.g. take ownership of a key strand of work on the project, under mentorship`
`Communication skills will be required to present research findings and papers at academic and professional conferences, and contribute to the external visibility of the Institute`
`Carry out collaborative projects with colleagues at the Turing, in partner institutions, and research groups`
	
In my scientific career, I have moved from quantum mechanics to classical statistical physics, and on to applied mathematics and machine learning. This is supported by my track record of 26 refereed research articles (including 2 book chapters) and 33 scientific talks across a number of areas (statistical physics, applied maths and machine learning). 

I have won awards for my research (e.g. Marie Curie Early-Stage Researcher, William Wakeham Award at Imperial College London), and secured funding (e.g. Imperial College Pathways to Impact). This demonstrates my experience in developing and implementing research strategies, as well as nurturing fruitful collaborations. I have active collaborations, including joint publications, with a number of national and international institutions (including Imperial College London, Universite Libre De Bruxelles, Institute of Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences).

I developed and support Python packages for PDE-related variational auto-encoders, Bayesian experimental design, a MATLAB toolbox for solving equations of classical density functional theory. These are in the process of being published via Turing's GitHub.  

As already mentioned, I am actively collaborating with BAS, which is a Turing partner institution on DT for Antarctic Ozone Hole, which includes quantification of uncertainty due to calibration error, data-driven determination of zenith ozone equations, and future on-site deployment of my code on Raspberry-Pi microcomputers in-situ, in Antarctica.

(3) `Evidence of own continued professional development`

To maintain my professional development, I regularly take part in interest groups and journal clubs at Turing, as panellist, speaker, and attendee. I regularly attend conferences and seminars, and I regularly take online courses in programming and AI to keep abreast of the latest developments. I am an expert programmer in Python, Matlab and R. I am proficient in ML and AI python packages, including JAX, TensorFlow and PyTorch; probabilistic programming packages, including PyMC3, NumPyro, Pyro and GPy; computational engines, such as Fenics (for partial differential equations), GPy (for Gaussian Process), and other tools for ML, AI and applied maths research.  

(4) `Commitment to EDI principles and to the Organisation values`
I am committed to EDI principles of inclusivity and fostering safe work environments. 

I have experience of being a postdoc-representative at the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London. This gave me a chance to contribute to the implementation of equality, diversity and inclusion. I used to attend meetings of Athena Swan committee, and departmental strategic meetings at Imperial, discussing and implementing EDI principles in the workplace. 

I am a naturalised UK citizen of Ukrainian descent. Having been born on the territory of Russia to a Ukrainian family, I am particularly aware of the need for sensitivity in dealing with people from a variety of backgrounds. I personally have family, impacted by the current events in Ukraine and have done some volunteering work to support Ukrainian refugees in London. 

(5) `Fellows will be expected to engage closely with the Programme Manager to develop the programme` and `contribute to Turing Skills`

I have administrative experience as Postdoctoral Representative for Department of Chemical Engineering at ICL. This involved co-organising seminars and Departmental Postdoc Symposia. I participated in meetings with the Department Strategic Advisory Board and Athena SWAN Committee. At university level, I took part in regular meetings with the Provost and ‘Postdoc Development Centre’. This experience has given me insight into the challenges faced by research and teaching staff. I have gained a practical understanding of the administrative side of a higher education institution, and the relationship between academia, government politics and industry. I will be happy to contribute meaningful feedback and ideas to the development of the Turing Fellowship. 

Additionally, I hold a fellowship of Higher Education Academy and have 5 years of experience in delivering lectures, tutorials and designing teaching materials. I will be happy to take part in teaching activities and outreach programs of engagement with the public and Turing Skills activities.
