*A The Turing Way inspired project to enable reproducibility in data science.*

## About this Repository

This is a template for setting-up a research or data science project online, such as on GitHub.
This repository includes files and directories recommended for enabling reproducibility and collaboration in a project, as well as sharing of research objects.

This repository follows the recommendations and guidance provided in *[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)* handbook to data science.
When reusing this repository, please update information on your README page with information about your project.

## About README

On an online repository, such as GitHub, the project overview page is named ‚ÄòREADME‚Äô which is equivalent to the main page of a website.
README page should describe the project -- what is the purpose of the project, who is involved, how to collaborate and where to find key resources.

To learn more about how to create a README.md file, please read the [Landing Page - README File](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-readme.html) chapter in The Turing Way Guide for Project Design.
