1. Is $S$-value in [[2 R-Dial to N-Values]] dependent on the wavelength or is it the same for A, C, D waves? 

# Intensities
In notebook, `Lo(W_i)` is added to the zenith `L(W_i)`. So is it the calibration error? Why then is it called 'Lo'? Confusing with $N=L_0-L$.


# mu
In Notebook, alculation of mu uses fixed Lat and other constants, yet data files `Z6_Dataframe_zenith.csv` and `Z6_Dataframe_direct.csv` contain Lat.
